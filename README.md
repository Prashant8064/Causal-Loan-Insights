# 🧠 Causal Loan Insights  
### Fairness-Aware & Explainable Real-Time Loan Decision System

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Loan approval systems widely used today often suffer from **hidden bias, lack of transparency, and unfair decision-making**, leading to exclusion of deserving applicants.

**Causal Loan Insights** is an **Ethical AI-powered FinTech solution** that delivers **fair, explainable, and real-time loan decisions** by combining:
- Fairness-aware Machine Learning  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Real-time interactive deployment  

This project is developed as a **Final Year Capstone Project (IIT Patna standard)** with strong emphasis on **Responsible & Trustworthy AI**.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Enable **real-time loan approval prediction**
- Detect and mitigate **algorithmic bias**
- Ensure **transparent and explainable decisions**
- Promote **ethical, inclusive, and socially responsible lending**

## 🏗️ System Architecture


---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The system uses **structured tabular loan datasets** consisting of financial and demographic attributes:

- Age  
- Income  
- Work Experience  
- House Ownership  
- Credit History  

### Dataset Handling
- Missing values handled via statistical imputation  
- Data normalization and encoding applied  
- Bias-prone attributes explicitly monitored  

📂 Included datasets:
- `Training_Data.csv`
- `Test_Data.csv`
- `Sample_Prediction_Dataset.csv`

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Methodology
- **Model Type:** Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- **Learning Paradigm:** Supervised Learning
- **Sampling Strategy:** Stratified Sampling
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - AUC-ROC  

The model is optimized to balance **predictive performance and ethical constraints**.

---

## ⚖️ Fairness & Bias Mitigation
To ensure equitable outcomes, the system integrates **fairness-aware learning**:

- **Protected Attributes:** Age (extendable to Gender, Caste, etc.)
- **Fairness Metrics:**
  - Demographic Parity  
  - Equalized Odds  
- **Bias Mitigation Strategy:** In-processing fairness constraints  

This ensures decisions are **non-discriminatory and socially responsible**.

---

## 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)
To address the black-box nature of ML models, this system integrates:

- **SHAP:** Global and local feature importance
- **LIME:** Instance-level interpretability
- **Human-readable explanations** for every decision  

### Benefits
- Improved user trust  
- Regulatory compliance support  
- Transparent AI-driven decision-making  

---

## 📈 Experimental Results
- High predictive accuracy on unseen test data  
- Reduced disparity across protected groups  
- Consistent fairness metric improvements after mitigation  

📊 Results validate that **ethical AI does not compromise performance**.

---

## 🚀 Deployment
- **Framework:** Gradio
- **Capabilities:**
  - Real-time loan eligibility prediction
  - Interactive user interface
  - Explainable output for each decision  

This enables seamless demonstration and real-world usability.
